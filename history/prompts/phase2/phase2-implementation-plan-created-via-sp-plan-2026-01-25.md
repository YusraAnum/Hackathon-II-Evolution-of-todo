## Prompt

Create the Phase 2 implementation plan based ONLY on the approved specs.
Do not create tasks yet.

## Response

Created the Phase 2 implementation plan document at specs/phase2/plan.md following the proper SDD workflow using the /sp.plan command. The plan includes:
- Summary of the full-stack Todo application implementation
- Technical context with languages, dependencies, and performance goals
- Constitution check verifying compliance with monorepo structure, technology stack lock, and no assumptions rules
- Project structure defining the required monorepo layout with apps/backend and apps/frontend
- Complexity tracking section (empty as no violations exist)
