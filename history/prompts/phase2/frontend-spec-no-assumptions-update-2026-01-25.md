## Prompt

Update the Frontend Specification to remove an architecture assumption that violates the No Assumptions Rule.

In the Performance Requirements section, DELETE the line:

"Efficient rendering of todo lists with virtualization if needed for large datasets"

Do not add any replacement. Do not modify other sections.

## Response

Updated the frontend specification file (specs/phase2/frontend_spec.md) by removing the line that violated the No Assumptions Rule:

- Removed "Efficient rendering of todo lists with virtualization if needed for large datasets" from the Performance Requirements section

This change ensures compliance with the No Assumptions Rule by removing an assumption about virtualization requirements that weren't defined in the original specifications.
