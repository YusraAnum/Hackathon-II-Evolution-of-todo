## Prompt

Generate implementation tasks for Phase 2 based ONLY on the locked plan and specs.

## Response

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Phase 2 in specs/phase2/tasks.md following the locked specifications and plan. The tasks are organized in phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup Tasks (project structure and dependencies)
2. Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (database models, auth system)
3. Phase 3: User Authentication Story (US1 - signup/login pages, auth endpoints)
4. Phase 4: Todo Management Story (US2 - todo endpoints and frontend components)
5. Phase 5: UI Enhancement Story (US3 - UI components and responsive design)
6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (final configurations and testing)

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are documented, with an implementation strategy for MVP delivery focusing on US1 and US2.
